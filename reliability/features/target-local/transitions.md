# Target-local forced-GC transitions

Evidence: `artifacts/target-local-transitions/20261018T210459943-dfa8e472`.

`TargetLocalTransitionsVerify` ran `profile-gc 50 6000 3000 5` ten times in the Linux x64 container.
The run records kernel `5.15.153.1-microsoft-standard-WSL2`, x64, with 4 CPUs. Earlier transition runs did not record the host.
While at least one profiled thread is in its work phase, the main thread forces a blocking gen-2 GC every 5 ms.
The criteria are in [the transition plan](../../../lode/plans/target-local-transitions.md). The runner hashes that file, and all source hashes stay unchanged.
The sample runs through the checked library entry point `TargetLocalProfiler.runBound` with a `CodeBinding`. `native/WriteTargetLocalEvidence.py` writes this page.

**Result: the current check passes.** Earlier failed checks stay part of the evidence.

| Run | Passed | Ledger failure | Max observed debt (ns) | Forced GCs in work window | Max handler (ns) | Wall minus counted CPU (ms) | Epochs complete, zero loss |
| ---: | --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| 1 | Yes | None | 1,349,882 | 19 | 2,005,363 | 6.0 | Yes |

No run crashed or hung. Every run closed both epochs with zero loss, retired both sessions, and restored the handlers.
The `cleanup` check passes. A profile whose monitor throws raises `AggregateException`, and a second profile in the same process then passes.
The `barrier-abort` check passes. A worker that throws releases its waiting peer, the run fails within 10 s, and a second profile then passes.
Every handler interval stays below 5 ms, and no run records a ledger failure. The longest is 2,025,076 ns.
Wall minus counted CPU is the largest per-thread difference. Counted CPU stops at disable and wall time includes the closing payment, so it is coarse.

## Run history

| Run | Change before the run | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `20261018T151031617-addf680d` | First check | Fail. 1 of 10 runs broke the debt bound. Its collection count was flawed. |

| `20261018T155026644-209a9e05` | Profiler moved into the library | Fail. Every run stopped on a perf-map parser defect before profiling. |
| `20261018T155303110-d6c77c03` | Parser accepts the `0x` prefix | Pass, 10 of 10 |
| `20261018T161924408-457ccd0e` | Cleanup on failure, native layout check, and payment address check | Pass, 10 of 10 |

| `20261018T182834143-78a15e0b` | Wait protocol in the ledger and the library | Fail. Run 4 broke the debt bound while the peer accepted no sample for six selected samples. |

## Earlier failed check

The first check counted collections from thread start to join. At least 5 ms passes between its forced collections.
Its 42 to 66 collections therefore needed 210 to 330 ms of thread lifetime, while its timed work lasted about 110 ms.
Most of its collections fell outside profiling, so that check did not measure what it claimed.

That check also failed. Nine of ten runs passed. Run 4 recorded `debt_exceeded`.
In sequences 71 through 80 of run 4, the selected thread accepts five selected samples and publishes 2.5 ms of credit.
The journal holds no peer sample in that interval. Sequence 82 records the failure at 2,499,985 ns of debt.
The ledger then pays the debt in bounded children. It forgives nothing.
The journal has no scheduling or GC suspension times, so it cannot show why the peer accepted no sample.
One hypothesis is that the host or the GC deschedules one thread. Profile results now record thread CPU and wall time to test it.

## Consequence

The passing current-design checks hold 100 runs with no failure. Two current-design checks each fail 1 of 10 runs with the same signature as the first failure.
A thread can go without samples long enough to break the 2 ms debt bound. The cause is unknown.
GC-heavy workloads stay outside the supported model. The debt bound stays unchanged.

## Check limits

The current runner requires exactly 10 runs. The first run used an earlier runner revision with 10 runs.
A forced collection starts only while a worker reports that it is working. The count does not show how long each collection overlaps the work.
The checks do not measure prediction accuracy under GC.

## Lifecycle checks

- `bindingTieredPassed`: pass
- `bindingDefaultPassed`: pass
- `shutdownPassed`: pass

`bindingTiered` runs with tiering on and requires both a configuration error and a rejected capture. `bindingDefault` requires a capture that still verifies after 100 ms of work.
`shutdown` requires an exit through `Environment.Exit` while a worker is still working. In this run the exit code is 0. The check does not show that a handler was inside a payment spin at the exit.
The checks do not cover ReJIT or thread abort. See [the lifecycle plan](../../../lode/plans/target-local-lifecycle.md).

See [the support boundary](../../../docsSrc/Explanations/target-local-prediction.md) and [the prediction qualification](prediction.md).
